# TV Script Generation

In this project, I have generated my own TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks - specifically Long Short Term Memory cells aka LSTMs. I made use of the Simpsons dataset scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

Traditional neural networks do not address the concept of persistence. The idea that you don't throw everything you understood before away and start thinking from scratch again. Recurrent neural networks address this issue, they are networks with loops in them, allowing for information to persist. This is especially beneficial for generating textual content like in this project.
