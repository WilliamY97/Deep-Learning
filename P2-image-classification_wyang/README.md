# Image Classification

In this project, I classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset is preprocessed, then I developed a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 

I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. The final model was able to classify images with about a 70% accuracy rate. The reason that the accuracy is lower than what is seen on the leaderboards for this data set is that such individuals and teams have implemented much more advanced concepts with their network to achieve higher accuracy.

My next steps are to research these concepts as to try and improve my model accuracy rate.
