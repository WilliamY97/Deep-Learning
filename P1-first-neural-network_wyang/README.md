# Bike Sharing Prediction Neural Net

In this project, I built my first neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. In this
case it is to predict daily bike rental ridership. By building a neural network from the ground up, I gained a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before I begin with higher level tools such as Tensorflow.

The project was developed in a Python Notebook and as such, you are able to see the visualizations and code by accessing the **Your_first_neural_network.ipynb** file located in this repository.

The data from this project comes from the **UCI Machine Learning Database**.
