# First Neural Network

In this project, I built my first neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset.
By building a neural network from the ground up, I gained a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation,
and other concepts that are important to know before I begin with higher level tools such as Tensorflow.

The data from this project comes from the **UCI Machine Learning Database**.
